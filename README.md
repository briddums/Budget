# Budget
This console program will read in a list of expenses from the included xml file.

It will then generate the projected expenses for the specified month and break it into two parts: 1st to 14th and 15th to end of month.

It will also calculate the average amount per paycheck that I need to save in order to pay those expenses.  This is calculated over the previous year, and is rounded up to the nearest $25.

Basically this allows me to have a 2nd account for monthly expenses. Each paycheck I then know how much to move to that account to guarantee that all my monthly expenses will be paid.
